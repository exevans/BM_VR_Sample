# BM_VR_Sample
(SAMPLE - this is only a small subset of the files) A VR magic based game in UE4. Very much a work in progress, currently allows for fireballs, teleportation, invisibility, spell traps, magical shields, telekinesis. 
Systems are systemic so spells can be combined intuitively. Enemies have access to the same abilities as players, with AI attempting to block and attack back. 
Uses mainly C++ and some blueprints to tune values without needing recompiling. 
NOTE this is a small sample of the C++ content used in the applicaiton
